       java
       String logFilePath = "C:\\path\\to\\sample_ssh.log.txt";

4. Compile the Project
  - Right-click on project → Build Project
  - Ensure no compilation errors

# **Usage**
**Running Apache Log Analysis**
   - Right-click on ApacheLogParser.java
   - Select Run As → Java Application
   - View detection results in console
**Running SSH Log Analysis**
   - Right-click on SSHLogParser.java
   - Select Run As → Java Application
   - View detection results in console
**Using Custom Log Files**
    *Replace the sample log files with your own:*
       - Ensure Apache logs follow Common Log Format
       - Ensure SSH logs follow OpenSSH syslog format
       - Update file paths in the parser files

# **Detection Mechanisms**
1. Brute-Force Attack Detection
Target: SSH Authentication Logs
Threshold: 5 failed login attempts per IP address
Algorithm:
text
For each SSH log entry:
    If event type == "FAILED":
        Increment failure count for source IP
    If failure count >= 5:
        Generate ALERT for brute-force attack
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Brute-force attack detected from IP: 192.168.1.60 (5 failed login attempts)

2. Port Scanning Detection
Target: Apache Web Server Logs
Threshold: 5 unique URLs accessed per IP address
Algorithm:
text
For each Apache log entry:
    Track unique URLs accessed by each IP
    If unique URL count >= 5:
        Generate ALERT for port scanning
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Port scan suspected from IP: 10.0.0.30 (accessed 5 different URLs)

3. Denial of Service (DoS) Detection
Target: Apache Web Server Logs
Threshold: 10 total requests per IP address
Algorithm:
text
For each Apache log entry:
    Increment request count for source IP
    If request count >= 10:
        Generate ALERT for potential DoS attack
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Possible DoS attack from IP: 192.168.1.70 (15 requests)

# **Technical Implementation**
Regular Expression Patterns
Apache Log Pattern:

java
String logPattern = "(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}).*\\[(.*)\\].*\"(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE) (.*) HTTP.*?\" (\\d{3})";
SSH Failed Login Pattern:

java
String failedPattern = "(\\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+).*Failed password for(?: invalid user)? (\\w+) from (\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3})";
SSH Successful Login Pattern:

java
String acceptedPattern = "(\\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+).*Accepted password for (\\w+) from (\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3})";
Data Structures Used
Structure	Purpose	Usage
HashMap<String, Integer>	Request counting	Track requests per IP
HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>	URL tracking	Monitor unique URLs per IP
ArrayList<LogEntry>	Log storage	Store parsed log entries
HashSet<String>	Unique URL storage	Prevent duplicate URL counting
Detection Parameters
java
// Configurable thresholds
final int BRUTE_FORCE_THRESHOLD = 5;    // Failed login attempts
final int PORT_SCAN_THRESHOLD = 5;       // Unique URLs accessed
final int DOS_THRESHOLD = 10;            // Total requests


# **Security Recommendations**
Based on detection results, the system recommends:

***Immediate Actions:***
  - Block critical threat IPs at firewall level immediately
  - Disable root SSH access - enforce key-based authentication only
  - Implement fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention system
  - Enable two-factor authentication for all administrative accounts
  - Review and strengthen password policies
***Enhanced Monitoring***
  - Reduce failed attempt threshold to 3 for root accounts
  - Implement real-time alerting for administrative account failures
  - Monitor medium-risk IPs for escalation patterns
  - Cross-reference suspicious IPs with threat intelligence databases
