Update file paths in the parser files

🔐 Detection Mechanisms
1. Brute-Force Attack Detection
Target: SSH Authentication Logs
Threshold: 5 failed login attempts per IP address
Algorithm:

text
For each SSH log entry:
    If event type == "FAILED":
        Increment failure count for source IP
    If failure count >= 5:
        Generate ALERT for brute-force attack
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Brute-force attack detected from IP: 192.168.1.60 (5 failed login attempts)
2. Port Scanning Detection
Target: Apache Web Server Logs
Threshold: 5 unique URLs accessed per IP address
Algorithm:

text
For each Apache log entry:
    Track unique URLs accessed by each IP
    If unique URL count >= 5:
        Generate ALERT for port scanning
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Port scan suspected from IP: 10.0.0.30 (accessed 5 different URLs)
3. Denial of Service (DoS) Detection
Target: Apache Web Server Logs
Threshold: 10 total requests per IP address
Algorithm:

text
For each Apache log entry:
    Increment request count for source IP
    If request count >= 10:
        Generate ALERT for potential DoS attack
Example Alert:

text
[ALERT] Possible DoS attack from IP: 192.168.1.70 (15 requests)

🛠️ Technical Implementation
Regular Expression Patterns
Apache Log Pattern:

java
String logPattern = "(\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}).*\\[(.*)\\].*\"(GET|POST|PUT|DELETE) (.*) HTTP.*?\" (\\d{3})";
SSH Failed Login Pattern:

java
String failedPattern = "(\\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+).*Failed password for(?: invalid user)? (\\w+) from (\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3})";
SSH Successful Login Pattern:

java
String acceptedPattern = "(\\w+ \\d+ \\d+:\\d+:\\d+).*Accepted password for (\\w+) from (\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3})";
Data Structures Used
Structure	Purpose	Usage
HashMap<String, Integer>	Request counting	Track requests per IP
HashMap<String, HashSet<String>>	URL tracking	Monitor unique URLs per IP
ArrayList<LogEntry>	Log storage	Store parsed log entries
HashSet<String>	Unique URL storage	Prevent duplicate URL counting
Detection Parameters
java
// Configurable thresholds
final int BRUTE_FORCE_THRESHOLD = 5;    // Failed login attempts
final int PORT_SCAN_THRESHOLD = 5;       // Unique URLs accessed
final int DOS_THRESHOLD = 10;            // Total requests
🔒 Security Recommendations
Based on detection results, the system recommends:

Immediate Actions
✅ Block critical threat IPs at firewall level immediately

✅ Disable root SSH access - enforce key-based authentication only

✅ Implement fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention system

✅ Enable two-factor authentication for all administrative accounts

✅ Review and strengthen password policies

Enhanced Monitoring
📊 Reduce failed attempt threshold to 3 for root accounts

📊 Implement real-time alerting for administrative account failures

📊 Monitor medium-risk IPs for escalation patterns

📊 Cross-reference suspicious IPs with threat intelligence databases
